# Inspiration

Doctors now a days have so much information to filter through, with leaps and bounds being made each year in the medical industry. 

New Diseases, cures, and medications are all very hard for them to cram, especially as doctors get a larger workload.

Thus our application was made to give doctors a quick summary and reference to research papers online.

# What it does

In this application, you can click on the different body parts of a human body to select the part you would like to learn more about.

Following this, we will provide you with related research papers, and with the power of AI, provide you with a summary, and TLDR in a nice one page read through.

# How we built it

Through this hackathon, the 4 of us all gathered round, and ideated many ideas, then split the workload to make full use of the short 24 hours given to us.

We..................

We also all wanted to faking kill ourselves

# Challenges we ran into

Creating a dynamic image map was partiularly difficult, needing to track each image and its appropriate reference areas.

We also had lots of trouble setting up our APIs to work as intended.

# Accomplishments we are proud of

Nothing, we wanna fakin die

# What we learnt

That snacks are very important for hackathons, as our moral dropped quite heavily once we ran out.

# What's next for DRGO

In future development, we plan on expanding the amount of content we can recieve and contact working professionals to get their opinion on our application so it can be refined to a stage that we can help real doctors with.
